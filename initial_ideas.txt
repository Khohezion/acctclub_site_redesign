INITIAL IDEAS:

Acronyms: 
IS: Director of Information Systems
HR: Director of Human Resources

General Goals:
1. Make it so members use the website more
  - Members dont use the damn website, we need to have more traffic on the website
2. Perhaps interchange the roles that HR and IS have? (Eric's idea)
  - Make it so the IS handles the input of data for events and HR can deal with the Ledger
    - Reasoning: Data is information... Ledger deals with communicating with the members
    - This also gives IS a bigger role in the club allowing it so they can communicate and help the other board members.
